<p>MCT oil is a supplement often added to smoothies, bulletproof coffee and salad dressings.</p>



<p>As the name suggests, medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil contains medium-length chains of fats called triglycerides. Due to their shorter length, MCTs are easily digested and many health benefits are linked to the way your body processes these fats.</p>



<p>MCT oil is most commonly extracted from coconut oil, as more than 50% of the fat in coconut oil comes from MCTs. These fats are also found in many other foods, such as palm oil and dairy products (<a href="/" target="_blank">1Trusted Source</a>).</p>



<p>Four different types of MCTs exist, of which caprylic and capric acid are most commonly used for MCT oil. In some cases, these specific types have unique benefits.</p>



<p>Here are 7 science-backed benefits you can get from adding MCT oil to your diet.</p>



<h3>Promotes Weight Loss in Several Important Ways </h3>



<p>There are several reasons why MCT oil may be beneficial when you’re trying to lose weight.</p>



<p>MCT oil has been shown to increase the release of two hormones that promote the feeling of fullness in the body: peptide YY and leptin (<a href="/" target="_blank">2Trusted Source</a>).</p>



<p>It may even be better than coconut oil in keeping you full. One study found that people taking two tablespoons of MCT oil as part of their breakfast ended up eating less food for lunch compared to those taking coconut oil (<a href="/" target="_blank">3</a>).</p>



<p>The same study also discovered a lower rise in triglycerides and glucose with MCT oil, which may also influence the feeling of fullness.</p>



<p>Additionally, taking&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/mct-oil-101">MCT oil</a>&nbsp;has been shown to significantly reduce body weight and waist circumference. Researchers even report that it could help prevent obesity (<a href="/" target="_blank">4Trusted Source</a>,&nbsp;<a href="/" target="_blank">5Trusted Source</a>,&nbsp;<a href="/" target="_blank">6Trusted Source</a>).</p>



<p>MCT oil has about 10% fewer calories than long-chain triglycerides (LCTs), which are found in foods such as olive oil, nuts and avocados (<a href="/" target="_blank">7Trusted Source</a>,&nbsp;<a href="/" target="_blank">8</a>).</p>



<p>Your body also processes MCTs differently, which may help you burn calories (<a href="/" target="_blank">4Trusted Source</a>,&nbsp;<a href="/" target="_blank">9Trusted Source</a>,&nbsp;<a href="/" target="_blank">10Trusted Source</a>).</p>



<p>Your body can use MCT oil as an instant source of energy, making it unnecessary to store fat for this purpose. Nevertheless, it’s important to note that your body may adapt to this dietary change, leading to only temporary results (<a href="/" target="_blank">6Trusted Source</a>,&nbsp;<a href="/" target="_blank">10Trusted Source</a>).</p>



<p>MCTs can be converted into ketones, which are produced from the breakdown of fat when carb intake is low. If you’re following a ketogenic diet, which is very low in carbs yet high in fat, then taking MCT oil can help you stay in the fat-burning state known as&nbsp;<a href="/">ketosis</a>.</p>



<p>Lastly, your gut environment is very important when it comes to your weight. MCT oil can help optimize the growth of good bacteria and support the gut lining, which could also help you lose weight (<a href="/" target="_blank">11Trusted Source</a>).</p>



<p></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> <strong>SUMMARY</strong>MCT oil may support weight loss by increasing fullness, fat loss, energy burning, ketone production and by improving your gut environment. </p></blockquote>



<p>And there you have it! A Spooky Spider Crackle Cake.</p>



<p>To serve, use a sharp knife cut down the centre, and the cake should crack into pieces. This cake will keep in the fridge for up to two weeks, making it an ideal recipe to prepare in advance.</p>

<p>MCT oil is a supplement often added to smoothies, bulletproof coffee and salad dressings.</p>



<p>As the name suggests, medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil contains medium-length chains of fats called triglycerides. Due to their shorter length, MCTs are easily digested and many health benefits are linked to the way your body processes these fats.</p>



<p>MCT oil is most commonly extracted from coconut oil, as more than 50% of the fat in coconut oil comes from MCTs. These fats are also found in many other foods, such as palm oil and dairy products (<a href="/" target="_blank">1Trusted Source</a>).</p>



<p>Four different types of MCTs exist, of which caprylic and capric acid are most commonly used for MCT oil. In some cases, these specific types have unique benefits.</p>



<p>Here are 7 science-backed benefits you can get from adding MCT oil to your diet.</p>



<h3>Promotes Weight Loss in Several Important Ways </h3>



<p>There are several reasons why MCT oil may be beneficial when you’re trying to lose weight.</p>



<p>MCT oil has been shown to increase the release of two hormones that promote the feeling of fullness in the body: peptide YY and leptin (<a href="/" target="_blank">2Trusted Source</a>).</p>



<p>It may even be better than coconut oil in keeping you full. One study found that people taking two tablespoons of MCT oil as part of their breakfast ended up eating less food for lunch compared to those taking coconut oil (<a href="/" target="_blank">3</a>).</p>



<p>The same study also discovered a lower rise in triglycerides and glucose with MCT oil, which may also influence the feeling of fullness.</p>



<p>Additionally, taking&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/mct-oil-101">MCT oil</a>&nbsp;has been shown to significantly reduce body weight and waist circumference. Researchers even report that it could help prevent obesity (<a href="/" target="_blank">4Trusted Source</a>,&nbsp;<a href="/" target="_blank">5Trusted Source</a>,&nbsp;<a href="/" target="_blank">6Trusted Source</a>).</p>



<p>MCT oil has about 10% fewer calories than long-chain triglycerides (LCTs), which are found in foods such as olive oil, nuts and avocados (<a href="/" target="_blank">7Trusted Source</a>,&nbsp;<a href="/" target="_blank">8</a>).</p>



<p>Your body also processes MCTs differently, which may help you burn calories (<a href="/" target="_blank">4Trusted Source</a>,&nbsp;<a href="/" target="_blank">9Trusted Source</a>,&nbsp;<a href="/" target="_blank">10Trusted Source</a>).</p>



<p>Your body can use MCT oil as an instant source of energy, making it unnecessary to store fat for this purpose. Nevertheless, it’s important to note that your body may adapt to this dietary change, leading to only temporary results (<a href="/" target="_blank">6Trusted Source</a>,&nbsp;<a href="/" target="_blank">10Trusted Source</a>).</p>



<p>MCTs can be converted into ketones, which are produced from the breakdown of fat when carb intake is low. If you’re following a ketogenic diet, which is very low in carbs yet high in fat, then taking MCT oil can help you stay in the fat-burning state known as&nbsp;<a href="/">ketosis</a>.</p>



<p>Lastly, your gut environment is very important when it comes to your weight. MCT oil can help optimize the growth of good bacteria and support the gut lining, which could also help you lose weight (<a href="/" target="_blank">11Trusted Source</a>).</p>



<p></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> <strong>SUMMARY</strong>MCT oil may support weight loss by increasing fullness, fat loss, energy burning, ketone production and by improving your gut environment. </p></blockquote>



<p>And there you have it! A Spooky Spider Crackle Cake.</p>



<p>To serve, use a sharp knife cut down the centre, and the cake should crack into pieces. This cake will keep in the fridge for up to two weeks, making it an ideal recipe to prepare in advance.</p>
