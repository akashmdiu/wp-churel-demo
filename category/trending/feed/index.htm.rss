<p>MCT oil is a supplement often added to smoothies, bulletproof coffee and salad dressings.</p>



<p>As the name suggests, medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil contains medium-length chains of fats called triglycerides. Due to their shorter length, MCTs are easily digested and many health benefits are linked to the way your body processes these fats.</p>



<p>MCT oil is most commonly extracted from coconut oil, as more than 50% of the fat in coconut oil comes from MCTs. These fats are also found in many other foods, such as palm oil and dairy products (<a href="/" target="_blank">1Trusted Source</a>).</p>



<p>Four different types of MCTs exist, of which caprylic and capric acid are most commonly used for MCT oil. In some cases, these specific types have unique benefits.</p>



<p>Here are 7 science-backed benefits you can get from adding MCT oil to your diet.</p>



<h3>Promotes Weight Loss in Several Important Ways </h3>



<p>There are several reasons why MCT oil may be beneficial when you’re trying to lose weight.</p>



<p>MCT oil has been shown to increase the release of two hormones that promote the feeling of fullness in the body: peptide YY and leptin (<a href="/" target="_blank">2Trusted Source</a>).</p>



<p>It may even be better than coconut oil in keeping you full. One study found that people taking two tablespoons of MCT oil as part of their breakfast ended up eating less food for lunch compared to those taking coconut oil (<a href="/" target="_blank">3</a>).</p>



<p>The same study also discovered a lower rise in triglycerides and glucose with MCT oil, which may also influence the feeling of fullness.</p>



<p>Additionally, taking&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/mct-oil-101">MCT oil</a>&nbsp;has been shown to significantly reduce body weight and waist circumference. Researchers even report that it could help prevent obesity (<a href="/" target="_blank">4Trusted Source</a>,&nbsp;<a href="/" target="_blank">5Trusted Source</a>,&nbsp;<a href="/" target="_blank">6Trusted Source</a>).</p>



<p>MCT oil has about 10% fewer calories than long-chain triglycerides (LCTs), which are found in foods such as olive oil, nuts and avocados (<a href="/" target="_blank">7Trusted Source</a>,&nbsp;<a href="/" target="_blank">8</a>).</p>



<p>Your body also processes MCTs differently, which may help you burn calories (<a href="/" target="_blank">4Trusted Source</a>,&nbsp;<a href="/" target="_blank">9Trusted Source</a>,&nbsp;<a href="/" target="_blank">10Trusted Source</a>).</p>



<p>Your body can use MCT oil as an instant source of energy, making it unnecessary to store fat for this purpose. Nevertheless, it’s important to note that your body may adapt to this dietary change, leading to only temporary results (<a href="/" target="_blank">6Trusted Source</a>,&nbsp;<a href="/" target="_blank">10Trusted Source</a>).</p>



<p>MCTs can be converted into ketones, which are produced from the breakdown of fat when carb intake is low. If you’re following a ketogenic diet, which is very low in carbs yet high in fat, then taking MCT oil can help you stay in the fat-burning state known as&nbsp;<a href="/">ketosis</a>.</p>



<p>Lastly, your gut environment is very important when it comes to your weight. MCT oil can help optimize the growth of good bacteria and support the gut lining, which could also help you lose weight (<a href="/" target="_blank">11Trusted Source</a>).</p>



<p></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> <strong>SUMMARY</strong>MCT oil may support weight loss by increasing fullness, fat loss, energy burning, ketone production and by improving your gut environment. </p></blockquote>



<p>And there you have it! A Spooky Spider Crackle Cake.</p>



<p>To serve, use a sharp knife cut down the centre, and the cake should crack into pieces. This cake will keep in the fridge for up to two weeks, making it an ideal recipe to prepare in advance.</p>

<p>It doesn’t matter whether you want to call them categories, tags, boxes, or anything else. You can think of Ghost tags a lot like Gmail labels. By tagging posts with one or more keyword, you can organise articles into buckets of related content.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="basictagging">Basic tagging</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you write a post, you can assign tags to help differentiate between categories of content. For example, you might tag some posts with <code>News</code> and other posts with <code>Cycling</code>, which would create two distinct categories of content listed on <code>/tag/news/</code> and <code>/tag/cycling/</code>, respectively.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you tag a post with both <code>News</code> <em>and</em> <code>Cycling</code> – then it appears in both sections.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tag archives are like dedicated home-pages for each category of content that you have. They have their own pages, their own RSS feeds, and can support their own cover images and meta data.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="theprimarytag">The primary tag</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Inside the Ghost editor, you can drag and drop tags into a specific order. The first tag in the list is always given the most importance, and some themes will only display the primary tag (the first tag in the list) by default. So you can add the most important tag which you want to show up in your theme, but also add a bunch of related tags which are less important.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>News</strong>, Cycling, Bart Stevens, Extreme Sports</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this example, <strong>News</strong> is the primary tag which will be displayed by the theme, but the post will also still receive all the other tags, and show up in their respective archives.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="privatetags">Private tags</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sometimes you may want to assign a post a specific tag, but you don’t necessarily want that tag appearing in the theme or creating an archive page. In Ghost, hashtags are private and can be used for special styling.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, if you sometimes publish posts with video content – you might want your theme to adapt and get rid of the sidebar for these posts, to give more space for an embedded video to fill the screen. In this case, you could use private tags to tell your theme what to do.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>News</strong>, Cycling, #video</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here, the theme would assign the post publicly displayed tags of <code>News</code>, and <code>Cycling</code> – but it would also keep a private record of the post being tagged with <code>#video</code>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In your theme, you could then look for private tags conditionally and give them special formatting:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:code -->
<pre><code class="language-html">{{#post}}
    {{#has tag="#video"}}
        ...markup for a nice big video post layout...
    {{else}}
        ...regular markup for a post...
    {{/has}}
{{/post}}
</code></pre>
<!-- /wp:code -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can find documentation for theme development techniques like this and many more over on Ghost’s extensive <a href="https://themes.ghost.org/v1.23.0/">theme documentation</a>.</p>

<p> Welcome, it&#8217;s great to have you here.</p>



<p>We know that first impressions are important, so we&#8217;ve populated your new site with some initial&nbsp;<strong>getting started</strong>posts that will help you get familiar with everything in no time. This is the first one!</p>



<p><strong>A few things you should know upfront</strong>:</p>



<ol><li>Ghost is designed for ambitious, professional publishers who want to actively build a business around their content. That&#8217;s who it works best for.</li><li>The entire platform can be modified and customised to suit your needs. It&#8217;s very powerful, but does require some knowledge of code. Ghost is not necessarily a good platform for beginners or people who just want a simple personal blog.</li><li>For the best experience we recommend downloading the&nbsp;<a href="https://ghost.org/downloads/">Ghost Desktop App</a>&nbsp;for your computer, which is the best way to access your Ghost site on a desktop device.</li></ol>



<p>Ghost is made by an independent non-profit organisation called the Ghost Foundation. We are 100% self funded by revenue from our&nbsp;<a href="https://ghost.org/pricing">Ghost(Pro)</a>&nbsp;service, and every penny we make is re-invested into funding further development of free, open source technology for modern publishing.</p>



<p>The version of Ghost you are looking at right now would not have been made possible without generous contributions from the open source&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/TryGhost">community</a>.</p>



<h2 id="next-up-the-editor">Next up, the editor</h2>



<p>The main thing you&#8217;ll want to read about next is probably:&nbsp;<a href="https://axotic.themeix.com/the-editor/">the Ghost editor</a>. This is where the good stuff happens.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>By the way, once you&#8217;re done reading, you can simply delete the default&nbsp;<strong>Ghost</strong>&nbsp;user from your team to remove all of these introductory posts!</em></p></blockquote>
